# CodeWars-JS

Hey! This repo consists of my CodeWars challenge solutions in JavaScript. As a new developer, I am using CodeWars to improve my skills in data structures and algorithms, as well as the JS language. The solutions are stored in folders based off the challenge difficulty (8kyu is the easiest). Thanks for checking it out!

Let's get after it! ðŸ˜¤
